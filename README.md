## Objective

This project aims to simulate the service in a queue system with fixed numbers of tellers and customers, as defined by the user. Three types of customers are served, each with different service time characteristics. The simulation uses pseudo-random number generation methods to calculate inter-arrival times (IAT) and service times (ST) for customers and their types. It statistically analyzes waiting times, service times, and system idle times. The goal is to optimize the process and evaluate the service efficiency in different scenarios, providing a basis for potential service improvements.

## Summary

In this study, a computational simulation was conducted to analyze the queue system of a bank where customers of three different types (based on pseudo-random numbers) arrive at the counter for service. The simulation considers the generation of random numbers to determine the customer type, IAT, and ST, along with the current state of the customer queue to calculate waiting times, service times, and employee idle times. The aim is to replicate the real behavior of the system and obtain reliable average values (such as average waiting time, service time, system time, and employee idle time). Multiple executions were carried out to calculate confidence intervals for these main system metrics.

## Methodology

The problem involves modeling the service in a bank with different tellers and customer types, based on a fixed number defined by the system operator and pseudo-random numbers generated by the simulator. Most customers (60%) are of Type 1, while 30% are of Type 2, and the remaining 10% are of Type 3. This queue system is suitable for stochastic and dynamic simulation, as it depends on random variables and evolves over time. 

The implementation uses discrete-event simulation, as the customer type, IAT (Inter-Arrival Time), and ST (Service Time) take on defined values for each event of arrival and service in the system.

The simulation model calculates the customer type, IAT, ST, arrival time, service start time, service end time, waiting time in the queue, system time, and employee idle time for each customer. Below are the formulas for ST and IAT used, which vary according to the customer type:

### **Service Time (ST)**
- For Type 1 customers (60% o)f the total):
  - `ST(i) = -15 * ln(random(i)) + 15`
- For Type 2 customers (30% of the total):
  - `ST(i) = -40 * ln(random(i)) + 30`
- For Type 3 customers (10% of the total):
  - `ST(i) = -140 * ln(random(i)) + 60`

### **Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)**
- For all customer types:
  - `IAT(i) = -15 * ln(random(i))`

These formulas were implemented in the simulator, where the customer type is determined by the pseudo-random number generated for each customer and assigned based on the specified percentages. The arrival times are also determined by these random values.

The JavaScript code simulates the arrival and service of each customer at the bank. It uses a pseudo-random number generator to define the IAT and ST for each customer, both variables generated in seconds, with the customer's arrival time being determined cumulatively (i.e., the arrival of the next customer depends on the previous customer's arrival time plus the IAT). 

For each event, the simulator checks if at least one teller is available; otherwise, the customer is added to the waiting queue. Employee idle time is calculated whenever they remain without serving customers, helping to assess the service efficiency in the system.

To ensure result reliability, the simulation was run 1000 times. In each run, data was collected on waiting times, service times, and idle times, and confidence intervals were later calculated for each metric, allowing for a more precise statistical analysis. This process is essential to validate the model and ensure it accurately reflects the simulated banking system's behavior.

### **Input Data:**
- **Seed:** Used for generating pseudo-random numbers.
- **numClientes:** Number of customers passing through the simulation.
- **numFuncionarios:** Number of employees serving customers.
- **tempoMaximo:** Time duration of the simulation (in seconds).

### **Meaning of Each Generated Column:**
- **Arrival Time (Clock):** The arrival time of the current customer, calculated as the previous customer’s arrival time + IAT of the current customer (for the first customer, this value is just the IAT).
- **Service Start Time:** Dependent on when the customer arrives and whether the teller is busy serving other customers. If the customer arrives before the teller finishes serving the previous customer, they have to wait. In this case, the service start time will be when the teller is free, i.e., after the previous customer’s service end time.
- **Service End Time:** This represents when the service of the customer is completed. It is calculated by adding the Service Time to the Service Start Time. It indicates the exact time when the customer finishes their service, freeing the teller for the next customer.
- **Queue Time:** Represents the time the customer spent waiting in the queue before being served. This is calculated as the difference between the Service Start Time and the Arrival Time.
- **System Time:** This is the total time the customer spent in the bank, from arrival to the end of service. It is calculated by adding the Service Time and Queue Time.
- **Employee Idle Time:** This time represents the periods when the employee was not serving customers between consecutive services. It is calculated as the difference between the next customer’s Service Start Time and the previous customer’s Service End Time.
